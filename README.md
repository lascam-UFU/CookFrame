# CookFrame
Automated Approach for Constructing Framework Instantiation Documentation

A substantial effort, in general, is required for understanding APIs of application frameworks.  High-quality API documentation may alleviate the effort, but the production of such documentation still poses a major challenge for modern frameworks. To facilitate the production of framework instantiation documentation, we hypothesize that the framework code itself and the code of existing instantiations provide useful information. However, given the size and complexity of existent code, automated approaches are required to assist the documentation production. We propose an automated approach for constructing relevant documentation for framework instantiation based on source code analysis of the framework itself and of existing instantiations. The proposed approach organizes documentation in a Cookbook style, where the recipes are programming activities using the necessary API elements driven by the framework features.  We performed an empirical study, consisting of 3 experiments with 44 human subjects executing real framework instantiations aimed at comparing the use of the proposed Cookbooks to traditional manual framework documentation (baseline). The comparison criteria were time spent and correctness during instantiation activities, information usefulness, complexity of the activity, navigation, satisfaction, information localization and clarity. Our empirical assessment demonstrates that the generated Cookbooks presented better or, at least, non-significant difference when compared to the traditional documentation
